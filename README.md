A ten question trivia game.

**Github:** https://github.com/michelpm1/trivia-game
**Live App:** https://sad-almeida-2b9978.netlify.app

## Quick Start
To install required packages and run a local development server:
```
# install packages
npm i
# run dev server
npm run start
```

## NPM Commands
Run any of these with `npm run <command>`

|command|description|
|---|---|
|start|Launch webpack dev server|
|storybook|Launch Storybook|
|test|Lint and run integration tests|
|build|Build the app "Tests and linting must pass to succeed"|
|gen-docs|Generate Typedoc documentation|
|lint|Run lint checker|
|eject|Create react app script to eject all build tools and configurations making them manual

## Stack Overview
- Project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]
- Written in **Typescript**
- Docs generated by **Typedoc**
- State Management using **Redux** and **Thunks**
- Styling with **CSS Modules**
- Tests are run using **Jest**, with **Enzyme**
- Linting handled by **Eslint**, with **Prettier** formatting enabled
- **Storybook** integration
- **Netlify** integration

## Guidelines
- **Components** should be self-contained and not connected to application state.
- **Containers** wrap functional components that rely on application state.
- **Pages** define the structure of each view and connect components to actions and app state.

## DevNotes
- Added a minimal CI (builds to production only work if linting and tests are passing "You can verify netlify log to check info about build errors")
## Testing
UI testing can be done manually using Storybook, or programatically using Enzyme. Most of the testing complexity in this project revolves around state management, so reducer tests are included.
